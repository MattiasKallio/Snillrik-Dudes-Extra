# Snillrik Dudes Extra
My fancy plugin Snillrik Dudes is for adding and displaying people, coworkers, team, members etc on your page. You can read more about how it works below. 
The pluign is intended to be extended, so this is for adding extra ways to display the dudes. Maybe you have a design and want's to use that instead of the default ones. 

So you have to have the plugin first, but then there's a set of filter-functions and css to add new looks and an example for template. 

### Looks
Put the php-code in functions.php (it can be in and own plugin or other places too, but most likley you will want it to be in functions.php)
Put the CSS where CSS goes, so either a css file or in the customizer for the template.


### Template
The template gos in a folder called snillrik-dudes and is called singel_dude.php
CSS for your new template goes where css goes the same way as looks.

# Shut up and take my money?
