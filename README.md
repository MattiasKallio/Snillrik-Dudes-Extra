# Snillrik Dudes Extra
My fancy plugin Snillrik Dudes is for adding and displaying people, coworkers, team, members etc on your page. You can read more about how it works below. 
The pluign is intended to be extended, so this is for adding extra ways to display the dudes. Maybe you have a design and want's to use that instead of the default ones. 

So you have to have the plugin first, but then there's a set of js-code, css and stuff to add new looks. 

You can buy the plugin at code canyon [Dudes](https://codecanyon.net/item/dudes/35819561) it's currently the most underrated plugin there at 0 buys. :D

Good luck?
